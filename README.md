# Go-Nix

This is an educational project to write an interpreter in Go that simulates the functionality of the nix programming domain specific language.

I'm targeting Windows because there isn't really a good equivelent in that space.

*Note:* This is an educational project to help me learn using some of the things I enjoy in my worklife.

## Seconadary Objective

I really like PowerShell's PSD1 format for handling data.  The primary reason that I am undertaking this project is because I did not find a library to parse the psd1 files into golang structs.  :(

So Nix Programming language is an educational endeavor, and the Go PSD1 parser is one I want for work.
